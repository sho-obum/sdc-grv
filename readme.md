##  Changes Made ##
Made a new interface using bootstrap 5 in red white theme.
Changed with the previous interface which was made in 2015.
Added Navbar 
Made interface charismatic by adding doodles

## Things to do ##
Add Stories section (imp)
Remove previous css and files which are not useful
Sort and make the code more readable
Separate js scripts and css files from main index file

## Self Notes ## 
Mistakes 
Read and understand code first then start debugging. 
Try to get all connected files. Without testing the connectivity of all php files it is difficult to debug.
Its better to start from scratch than to repair and debug if its taking too much of your time.
