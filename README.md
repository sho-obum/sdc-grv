## ABOUT GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL PORTAL
In 2015, Our college made an online portal for filing complaints. For this a student, Gopal Prasad made a php based portal in which a student or a faculty member can file a complaint which can be later reviewed by any head or admin. It made a positive impact and everyone started using it instead of going desk to desk just to file a complaint regarding anything. Maintenance of this website comes under the Software Development Cell of our College. Now in 2022, our tech team changed its interface making it more charismatic.
